    <p>Lasagna is a layered Italian dish featuring sheets of pasta, rich meat, creamy cheese, and savory seasonings, baked to perfection for a comforting and indulgent meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>450g ground beef</li>
        <li> 1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 glass bottle (500g) tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 180Â°C. Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions, then drain and set aside.                     
         <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef (or Italian sausage) over medium heat until browned. Add chopped onions and minced garlic, and cook until the onions are softened and translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, water, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a baking dish. Place three lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Spread a layer of the cheese over the noodles. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top.
        </li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley, if desired.</li>
    </li>
    </ol>
