    <p>Homemade pasta is a delightful culinary endeavor involving combining flour and eggs into a dough, which is then rolled out, shaped, and cooked to perfection, offering a fresh and flavorful alternative to store-bought varieties.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250g all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 table olive oil</li>
        <li> 1-2 tablespoons water (if needed)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>On a clean work surface, mound the flour and create a well in the center.            
        <li>Crack the eggs into the well and add the salt.</li>
        <li>Using a fork, gradually incorporate the flour into the eggs until a dough starts to form.</li>
        <li>Once the dough comes together, knead it for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough feels too dry, you can add a little water, one tablespoon at a time.</li>
        <li>Once kneaded, shape the dough into a ball and wrap it in plastic wrap. Let it rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.</li>
        <li>After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions. Flatten each portion with a rolling pin or pasta machine until it reaches your desired thickness. You can dust the dough with flour to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Cut the rolled-out dough into your desired pasta shape. You can make fettuccine, spaghetti, or any other shape you prefer.</li>
        <li>Once you've cut the pasta, you can cook it immediately in boiling salted water for 2-4 minutes, or until al dente.</li>
        <li>Drain the cooked pasta and serve it with your favorite sauce, such as marinara, Alfredo, or pesto.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your homemade pasta! It's simple, delicious, and perfect for any occasion</li>
    </ol>
